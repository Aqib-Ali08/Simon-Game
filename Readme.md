Once the game loads, click on the "START" button to begin the game.

The game will start with a random sequence of colors. Watch and listen carefully to the sequence as the buttons light up and make a sound.

Now, it's your turn to repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the same order they were presented.

If you get the sequence correct, the game will play a longer sequence with an additional color added to it. If you get it wrong, the game is over.

You can choose to play on different difficulty levels by clicking on the "EASY", "MEDIUM", "HARD", or "INSANE" buttons at the bottom of the game board.

The game keeps track of your score and the high score for each difficulty level. Try to beat your high score and challenge yourself to reach higher difficulty levels.

If you need to pause the game or exit, you can do so by clicking on the "PAUSE" or "EXIT" buttons respectively.

Enjoy playing Simon Game and have fun!
